- 🔥 Junior Front-end Developer.

- 🔭 I’m currently working as Junior Front-end Developer, freelance helping Senior Full-stack Developers, and also a local Tech Company, with daily tasks. The tasks can include technologies and platforms such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript, Tailwindcss, React.JS, Axios, Formik, Yup, Jira, Git, GitFlow, Figma and others.

- 🌱 I’m currently studying front-end development, but also getting in touch with back-end development for a future full-stack carreer.

- 💬 I can speak Portuguese, Spanish, English, and I am currently studying Italian. 

- ▶️ I have an Instagram profile where I would like to share contents and experiences in the future [you can check it here: (https://www.instagram.com/cassio.dev/)]

- ⚡ Fun fact - My name is Cassiano, but my mom, family and friends call me Cassio. Feel free to choose.
